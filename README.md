# Travel Taniti

Welcome to the Travel Taniti project! This project was created as part of a class at Western Governors University (WGU). The goal was to redesign the website for the government of Taniti, focusing on improving the user interface (UI) and enhancing the user experience (UX) to promote tourism on the island.

## Project Overview

The government of Taniti wanted to revamp their old website to create a more engaging and informal guide to the island. The new site aims to attract tourists by showcasing the beauty and attractions of Taniti in a user-friendly manner.
